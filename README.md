# pdf-images
A tool to scrape images from pdf files

# How to install

A `requirements.txt` file is included. So simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the necessary packages.

(note: use `pip install --upgrade https://github.com/sylvainpelissier/PyPDF2/archive/master.zip` instead if PyPDF2 still doesn't work)
